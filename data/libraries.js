    description: `Jpex is a typescript library that intelligently injects dependencies at build time via babel.
This library was a labour of love that I worked on and refined over the course of 6 years. I felt the inversion of control principal was underappreciated in the javascript community, and other DI solutions were often cumbersome and clumsy. I wanted to create a DI client that required no setup and was super intuitive to use.
I also created several adapters to easily integrate jpex into React, Vue, and Node applications, and have used it in several projects over the years.`,
