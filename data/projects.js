    description: `NFTX is a platform that allows users to create and trade NFT index funds.
After working with NFTX previously, I was brought back to help create the v3 platform.
This involved building out an entirely new app from scratch, while maintaining the existing platform (and supporting migrations between the two).
The app was written in Typescript, Next.js, and TailwindCSS, as well as Wagmi, and Viem for blockchain interactions.
I soley created a new api server in node.js, using express, redis, bullMQ, and mongoDB.
I employed event-driven-design and miniservices, and followed functional programming paradigms and onion architecture.
An SDK created for the previous iteration was also completely rewritten and published to support v3.
I had a lead role in backlog grooming, sprint planning, and other scrum activities.
I also worked closely with the devops team to set up the supporting infrastructure.`,

    I came on board at the early startup stage. I helped build out the front-end of the platform, written with React and Next.js, as well as advise on best practices, artchitecture, and technology choices.
The app was written in Typescript, Next.js, and TailwindCSS. It also used several Web3 libraries including ethers.js to interact with the blockchain.
I later returned to help create a back-end API layer in node.js, using express and mongoDB. I also helped to set up the infrastructure and devops.
