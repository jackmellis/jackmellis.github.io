After working with NFTX previously, I was brought back to help out the V3 platform.
This involved building out an entirely new app from scratch, while maintaining the existing platform (and supporting migrations between the two).
The app was written in Typescript, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Wagmi, and Viem.
I also rewrote the back-end layer in node.js and set up the supporting infrastructure.`,
